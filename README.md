Dear Sir or Madam,
my name is Kyrylo Hlazkov. Since I am passionate about computer science and software development.
During 7th grade, I learned about the dynamic and visual programming language "Scratch". 
When I created a program (a combination of block connections) for the first time and let my cat move back and forth on the screen, I was very impressed. Since then, I have been very interested in programming languages ​​as well as information and news in the IT field.
In 9th grade, I started learning Python, Java and C++. Programming has now become an integral part of my life.
I am currently attending the Technical Vocational College 1 at the Commercial School in Waiblingen, which I will graduate in summer 2025.
I have a good knowledge of programming, mathematics and physics. For example, I took 3rd place in a cross-school, regional competition in mathematics and physics during 9th grade.
I was able to gain experience with teamwork at the "IT Step Academy", among other places, while we developed applications for school together.
I also received an award in the field of programming at the "Step IT Academy".
I am characterized by analytical and logical thinking skills as well as a systematic, structured and thorough way of working.
I also have an interest in and enthusiasm for problem solving.
I value the practice-oriented training and am convinced that it will prepare me optimally for my professional future.
I am happy to expand my knowledge and skills in a dynamic environment and to get involved.
I am very responsible, resilient, determined and hard-working. I am happy to take on unusual and creative tasks.
So that you can see my abilities for yourself, I am happy to do an internship and look forward to an invitation to an interview.
Best regards
